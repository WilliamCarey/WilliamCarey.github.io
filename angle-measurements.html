<h1>Angles in Right Triangles</h1>
		
<p>We've been talking about right triangles so far, and we've been talking about their angles. The central thing we've said is that a right angle measures 90&deg;, and the sum of all the angles in a triangle is 180&deg;. Those theorems are true - they're part of the eternal structure of the cosmos, woven into the nature of mathematics.</p>
		
<p id="angle-tangle">But the magnitudes of the measures -- those are arbitrary! We could have made the measure of all the angles in the triangle 24 hats. If we did that, then the measure of a right angle would be 12 hats. We could make the measure of a right angle <span data-var="ra" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="1" data-max="10000"> noses</span>. Then the measure of a whole triangle would be <span data-var="ta"> noses</span>. The eternal and true thing is the ratio of the right angle to the sum of the angles in the triangle. The numbers we put on that are just numbers we've chosen.</p>

<p class="caution">

</p>
		
<p id="triangle-tangle">Imagine we made the measure of a right angle <span data-var="ra" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="1" data-max="10000">&deg;</span>, then a whole triangle would have <span data-var="ta"></span>&deg; in it.

<h2>Why degrees?</h2>
		
180&deg; seems like a fairly random number to pick for the measure of the triangle. Why 180? Why not, say, 100? or 10? Or 100,000? The answer lies in factoring. 90 is evenly divisible by 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, and 18. So if you want to be able to talk about fractions of a right angle, 90 is actually a really nice angle to pick! 180 is also evenly divisible by 4 and 12, so it's even better! If we picked 10, then a third of that angle would be a mess. We've called the system where the measure of the angles in a triangle is 180 the <b>degrees</b> system.
		
		<h2>So, what else is there?</h2>

<p>Oh my gosh, so many other systems are in common use. A lameish one is to say that the sum of the measures of a triangle is 1. Then the measure of a right angle is 0.5. Kind of weaksauce, but you could see why it's nice.	
	
The one you'll run into the most is the radian system. In the radian system, the measure of a triangle is &pi; radians. This seems to have all the disadvantages imaginable. It's not nicely divisible like 180&deg;. It's not even a whole number! It's not even a rational number! What gives?</p>
