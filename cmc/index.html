		<p>
			This website is a place for us to work out how to teach mathematics classically and Christianly. The thesis of the website is that treating mathematics as one of her peer humanities is the most direct path towards that goal. Dave Mathwin, our history teacher at Ad Fontes, says that religion is upstream of culture, culture upstream of politics, and politics upstream of economics. So if you want to understand why a battle or election unfolds the way it unfolds, look first to the religious beliefs and then to the cultures of the societies involved. Analogously, I'd propose this stream for the mathematics classroom:
		</p>

		<p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">
			Religion is upstream of culture; <br>
			culture upstream of pedagogy; <br>
			pedagogy upstream of materials;</br>
			and materials upstream of assessments.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you have the right materials but the wrong culture, your classroom will not thrive. If you have the right culture, the right materials and assessments will flow from that.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Consequently, this website follows that progression. It has a page about the relationship between Christ and mathematics, a page about forming the culture of our mathematics classrooms, a page of interesting materials, and a page about how to assess student growth. I'd encourage you to look through them in that order -- the materials and assessments don't make much sense absent the cultural framework that animates them.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			And, naturally, culture is created by folks in community, so if you'd like to join a community of math teacers sharing in cultural formation, please contact me at <a href="mailto:bcarey@adfontes.com">bcarey@adfontes.com</a>!
