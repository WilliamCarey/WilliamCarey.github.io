	<h1>This is a tiny internet</h1>

    <p>Documents on the web are written in a language called HTML, which stands for hypertext markup language.</p>

	<p>Text on a website can contain links to <a href="cats">other documents</a>. That's what makes the web more useful than a regular document. Recently, people have decided that it's a good idea to allow <b>program code</b> to reside in html documents too. Whether this is a good idea or not is still unclear.</p>
